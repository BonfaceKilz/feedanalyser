        We consider real-time timely tracking of infection status (e.g., <span class="search-hit mathjax">covid</span>-<span class="search-hit mathjax">19</span>) of individuals in a population. In this work, a health care provider wants to detect infected people as well as people who recovered from the disease as quickly as possible. In order to measure the timeliness of the tracking process, we use the long-term average difference between the actual infection status of the people and their real-time estimate by the health care provider based on the most recent test results. We first find an analytical expression for this average difference for given test rates, and given infection and recovery rates of people. Next, we propose an alternating minimization based algorithm to minimize this average difference. We observe that if the total test rate is limited, instead of testing all members of the population equally, only a portion of the population is tested based on their infection and recovery rates. We also observe that increasing the total test rate helps track the infection status better. In addition, an increased population size increases diversity of people with different infection and recovery rates, which may be exploited to spend testing capacity more efficiently, thereby improving the system performance. Finally, depending on the health care provider&#39;s preferences, test rate allocation can be altered to detect either the infected people or the recovered people more quickly.

        The novel <span class="search-hit mathjax">COVID</span>-<span class="search-hit mathjax">19</span> pandemic is a current, major global health threat. Up till now, there is no fully approved pharmacological treatment or a vaccine. In this study, simple mathematical models were employed to examine the dynamics of transmission and control of <span class="search-hit mathjax">COVID</span>-<span class="search-hit mathjax">19</span> taking into consideration social distancing and community awareness. Both situations of homogeneous and nonhomogeneous population were considered. Based on the calculations, a sufficient degree of social distancing based on its reproductive ratio is found to be effective in controlling <span class="search-hit mathjax">COVID</span>-<span class="search-hit mathjax">19</span>, even in the absence of a vaccine. With a vaccine, social distancing minimizes the sufficient vaccination rate to control the disease. Community awareness also has a great impact in eradicating the virus transmission. The model is simulated on small-world networks and the role of social distancing in controlling the infection is explained.
